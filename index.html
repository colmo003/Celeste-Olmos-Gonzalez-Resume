        <div class="subheading mb-5">PsychologyðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a second-year Psychology student at the University of California-Riverside. I want to continue my education past UCR to pursue a career in clinical psychology. Psychology research is also very interesting to me because I feel that there are still many unanswered questions about psychology and other things related to it. There are many fields related to psychology that interest me but these two capture my attention the most. I am motivated by my background and culture because mental health is something that has been long neglected in Mexican culture. As a Latina, I feel that it is important to shed light on the lack of mental health awareness as well as advocate for a change in the stigmatization of seeking psychological help. I hope to achieve some of these goals in my career. I have already started being more open with my own family to help them understand why I am passionate about creating a change in the perception of mental health in society.<br><br>

        I have work experience in fast food, retail, and office work. My current position is as an office assistant in an optometry office where I do routine pre-testing for patients such as updating chart information, verifying patient demographics, conducting VAs, and using the Auto Refactor for readings. All the information gathered is then plugged into the patient virtual file and then updated for the doctor to see. After the pre-testing, I take patients into the doctorâ€™s office and open up the ExamWriter to have the room and patient prepared for when the doctor walks in. My responsibilities also include tasks such as sweeping, dusting, and disinfecting to ensure a safe and comfortable environment for patients. When there are no patients, I scan paper documents into their virtual charts for organization and safekeeping. 
<br><br>

        The most extensive part of my job experience has been in retail, where I worked for about two years. I worked primarily as a beauty consultant where I was cross-trained as a cashier, electronics sales associate, and order pick-up team member. During my time there, I learned how to read and set salesfloor planograms for quarterly sales updates. I was responsible for cleaning and disinfecting my area as well as having extensive knowledge of the products we had available for people with different accommodations. I regularly conducted price change where shelf labels and clearance labels were updated and updated EXR counts to ensure we were receiving shipments of products needed for the sales floor. I grew in my leadership and communication skills as well as learned many customer service skills that continue to help me to this day.
